# Contributing

We encourage any form of contribution, whether that be issues, comments, or pull requests. If you are submitting a PR, there are a few things we would appreciate that you do to keep the codebase clean:

* **Write tests.** Any new code should not drop the test coverage (run `npm run coverage`).
* **Follow the linter.** We use [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base). Run `npm run lint` before submitting a PR.
* **Ask questions if you aren't sure.** If you have any questions while implementing a fix or feature, feel free to create an issue and ask us. We're happy to help!
